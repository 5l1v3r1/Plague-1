# Plague
Plague is a Proof-of-Concept peer to peer botnet written in python, using twisted. <br>
The entire protocol is written from scratch, and is cleartext aswell. I started on it as a fun little side project to learn more about peer to peer botnets
<br>
Note, it has no NAT traversal capabilities, and is a really vulnerable project. If you wish to edit it go ahead. I will not accept any pull requests.

# Usage
Install Twisted (`pip install twisted`), and do whatever you want to do with the code :)
